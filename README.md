# Odas Blogg - Exame1
this was our final exam of the 1 year, and it has to be the biggest assignment we have done, showcasing what we have learned over the corse of a year. javascript, cms, html and css was used to bring this exam together.
the exam was to make a blog, so i went for an fiction blog written by a dog named oda, showcasing difffrent things the dog "had" done during the year, every blogpost was fetched fron an api i had set up in wordpress.
I choose to make a calm and easy to navigate blog, so its easy for the user to navigate to the desired blogpost, i felt a bit fancy when i made the blog, so the carouselle that was a requirement on the hompepage, i automated it, to sycle thru the pictures every 10 seconds when your on desktop, and every 5 sec when your on mobile.

### Description
-- homepage
there was 1 hard requirement in the brief for the homepage, and that was an carouselles that could be navigatet (lates posts) on your homepage, I tried to keep my design as clean and easy to understand as possible, without making it too boring to look at. when i built the carouselle i wanted it to be automaded incase the viewer wanted to read some of the other blogposts, and the carouselle could go thru the latest posts without needing any interaction, making it simple for the user, you also have the option to go thru the carouselle manually if thats what you want.
